language: English
summary: "<p>You run a barbershop with several barbers. You're curious about what\
  \ will happen if one of them quits. Will the workload for other barbers increase?\
  \ Will the average service time increase? These questions are hard to answer even\

  \ work of a barbershop under various conditions and learn how to analyze the results.</p><br/><br/>Learn\
