# Barbershop-Simulation-Hyperskill
This is "Barbershop Simulation" project form Hyperskill.<br>
Get acquainted in practice with the basic properties and characteristics of discrete and continuous random variables and learn how to evaluate them for simple and complex probabilistic models using Monte Carlo simulations.<br>
You run a barbershop with several barbers. You're curious about what will happen if one of them quits. Will the workload for other barbers increase? Will the average service time increase? These questions are hard to answer even if visitors come at regular intervals. For a more realistic case, it is even more difficult when clients come at random. In this project, you will simulate the work of a barbershop under various conditions and learn how to analyze the results.<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
