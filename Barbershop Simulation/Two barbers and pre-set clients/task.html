<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Your barbershop is open from 9 am, and the clients come at regular intervals of <span class="math-tex">\(m\)</span> minutes (the first client arrives precisely at 9 am); the first barber serves each visitor in <code class="java">s</code> minutes, and the second one does it in <span class="math-tex">\(t\)</span> minutes. When a new client comes, they go to an unoccupied barber. If they are both free, the client goes to the barber who is free for a more extended period of time; if both barbers are unoccupied for the same period of time, the client goes to the first master. If both barbers are busy, clients queue in line. At 4 pm, the barbershop closes. All those who come on that day before the closing time are served; no exceptions.</p>
<p>Based on this information, compute the following quantities for every client:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arrival time: when did the client come to the barbershop?</li>
<li>Waiting time: how long did they wait in line?</li>
<li>Barber: the first one or the second one?</li>
</ol>
<p>To determine the waiting time in the queue and the barber for each new client, it is suitable to calculate the values <span class="math-tex">\(a_{1,i}\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(a_{2,i}\)</span>, where <span class="math-tex">\(a_{1,i}\)</span> is the number of minutes after 9 am when the first barber is available, assuming that only the first <span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span> clients will come on that day, and <span class="math-tex">\(a_{2,i}\)</span> is the same value for the second barber. For example, <span class="math-tex">\(a_{1,1} = s\)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\(a_{2,1} = 0\)</span>. When the <span class="math-tex">\(i+1\)</span>-th client arrives at the <span class="math-tex">\(t_{i+1}\)</span> time, based on <span class="math-tex">\(t_{i+1}\)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\(a_{1,i}\)</span>, and <span class="math-tex">\(a_{2,i}\)</span>, we can determine which barber will be available first, and how long the client will have to wait in line. Then calculate <span class="math-tex">\(a_{1,i+1}\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(a_{2,i+1}\)</span> and process the <span class="math-tex">\(i+2\)</span>-th client.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Write a program that takes three numbers <span class="math-tex">\(m\)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\(s\)</span>, and <span class="math-tex">\(t\)</span> as input separated by a space, computes the arrival time, the waiting time, and the barber for every client who came before the closing time. Ensure the program prints this data for each client on a separate line in the order they arrive.</p>
<p>Output format:</p>
<p>If you've had <span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span> clients today, the output should consist of <span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span> lines, where the <span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span>-th line refers to the <span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span>-th client and has the form of <span class="math-tex">\(a\:w\:m\)</span> where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span> is the arrival time of the <span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span>-th visitor in minutes after 9:00 am,</li>
<li><span class="math-tex">\(w\)</span> is their waiting time in minutes,</li>
<li><span class="math-tex">\(m\)</span> is the barber, <code class="java">1</code> or <code class="java">2</code>.</li>
</ul>
